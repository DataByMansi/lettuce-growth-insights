# 🥬 Lettuce Growth Insights: Environmental Impact on Maturity Time

This project explores how environmental conditions — including temperature, humidity, pH, and total dissolved solids (TDS) — influence the number of days it takes for lettuce plants to reach maturity. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and feature engineering to uncover patterns and draw data-driven conclusions.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Kaggle — Lettuce Growth Days Dataset
- **Columns**:
  - `Temperature (°C)`
  - `Humidity (%)`
  - `TDS Value (ppm)`
  - `pH Level`
  - `Growth Days` (days to maturity)
  - `Date`, `Plant_ID`

## 🔍 SMART Questions

1. **Specific**: Is there a correlation between humidity and temperature in affecting lettuce growth?
2. **Measurable**: How many days on average does it take for lettuce to mature under varying temperature conditions?
3. **Action-Oriented**: Will increasing total dissolved solids reduce the number of days to maturity?
4. **Relevant**: Can this data inform better practices for indoor or greenhouse lettuce farming?
5. **Time-Bound**: What is the time span of the recorded data, and can it help forecast future growing conditions?

## 🧪 Key Analytics Performed

- **Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion**
- **Days to Weeks Conversion**
- **Humidity Bucketing (Low, Medium, High)**
- **Statistical Summary**: Mean, Median, Min, Max
- **Visualizations**:
  - Scatter Plot (Temperature vs Growth Days)
  - Bar Chart (Humidity vs Avg Growth Days)
  - Histogram (Growth Days Distribution)

## 🧠 Key Insights

- The average growth duration is **23.14 days**.
- Growth rates tend to increase slightly with temperature and optimal humidity.
- TDS values around **600 ppm** correlated with shorter growth times.
